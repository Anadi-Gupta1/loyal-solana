    "project_overview": "Solana Loyalty NFTs is a merchant loyalty platform that enables businesses to mint custom-branded loyalty tokens as SPL-NFTs on Solana. Customers receive verifiable on-chain loyalty NFTs for purchases and can redeem them atomically for discounts, perks, or exclusive access. The platform leverages Solana's low fees and fast finality to make micro-loyalty transactions economically viable. Merchants gain programmable loyalty campaigns with transparent redemption tracking, while customers enjoy portable, tradeable loyalty tokens that aren't locked to single platforms. The system includes merchant onboarding tools, campaign management dashboards, customer wallet interfaces, and real-time analytics. Built with Anchor framework for security and composability, featuring atomic mint/redeem operations and replay attack prevention.",
    "public_good": "This platform democratizes loyalty programs for small-medium merchants who traditionally lack access to sophisticated reward systems. By using Solana's public blockchain, loyalty data becomes transparent and portable across platforms, preventing vendor lock-in. Open-source codebase enables community contributions and merchant customizations. The platform reduces barriers to blockchain adoption for traditional businesses while showcasing Solana's capabilities for real-world commerce applications. Educational documentation and merchant onboarding guides will help non-technical business owners understand and utilize blockchain technology. The project contributes to Solana's ecosystem growth by demonstrating practical utility beyond speculation, potentially onboarding thousands of new users and merchants to the ecosystem.",
    "team_template": "Our team combines deep Solana/Rust expertise with traditional e-commerce experience. Lead developer has 3+ years building Anchor programs and extensive experience with SPL tokens and program security. Frontend specialist brings React/TypeScript mastery and wallet integration expertise from previous DeFi projects. Business development lead has 5+ years in merchant services and payment processing, understanding real-world merchant needs and compliance requirements. Design lead specializes in Web3 UX, focusing on bridging traditional commerce with blockchain complexity. Team has successfully delivered 2 previous Solana projects and maintains active involvement in the developer community through contributions to Anchor ecosystem tools.",
    "competitive_advantage": "Unlike existing loyalty platforms that use centralized databases, our solution provides verifiable on-chain proof of loyalty earnings and redemptions. Solana's sub-second finality enables real-time loyalty minting at point-of-sale, impossible with slower blockchains. Our atomic redemption mechanism prevents double-spending while maintaining decentralization. The platform's composability allows third-party integrations (loyalty aggregators, secondary markets) that centralized systems cannot support. Built-in programmable logic enables sophisticated campaigns (time-decay, tier upgrades, cross-merchant partnerships) without complex backend infrastructure. Low transaction costs make micro-loyalty rewards economically viable. Open architecture allows merchants to extend functionality through custom program interactions.",
